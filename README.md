           Electromyography Signal Analysis with Representation as Visual Display
Advances in integrated circuit have had a major impact on digital signal processing techniques. 
Applications of these techniques are now widespread in areas such as autonomous vehicles, biomedical engineering, 
speech communication, radar and many others. The motivation of the project is to applies digital signal processing
techniques to record the electrical activity of human arm muscle tissues to develop hardware, and application to 
assist disabled people with amputation. The techniques acquire in this project can be used to build robotic arm, 
or other devices to assist disabled people. The focus of this project is to use digital signal processing to study
the arm muscle, and determine if a person does rock, paper, or scissors.
